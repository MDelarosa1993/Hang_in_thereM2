### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem? Answer: It aloows users to create, save, and display motivational and unmotivational posters. Features are generating random posters and creating posters, and aslo saving them. Problem it is solving by letting the user personalize posters by allowing users to customize and save their own.)

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running? Answer: got to repository and clone it down to a directory. Open up the directory and Go Live on your HTML.)

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred! Answer: I cant provide a snapshot but the alerts for the saved posters is my coolest piece.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?) Answer: This project focuses on DOM manipulation and JavaScript fundamentals. I worked on the project for a week and a half. And i am in Mod 2)

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to your GitHub. Consider also providing LinkedIn link Answer: Melchor De La Rosa, https://www.linkedin.com/in/melchor-de-la-rosa-465079222/)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with? Answer: To try and again some profiency in Javascript for DOM manipulation use event handling to create dynamic uder interactions.)

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them? Wins: the ability to save and display custom posters, and switching between motivational and unmotivational posters, and using CSS.
